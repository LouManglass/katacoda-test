First: if you'd prefer, you can [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/optic-onboarding/30-min-session) with us. You may find it helpful to not only review your issue, but also get some advice for your specific project.

**Which installer did you use?**
- Which [install process](https://docs.useoptic.com/getting-started/installing-optic) did you follow so far? 
- Did you have an issue with the install process, or was installation successful?

If successful, please report the results of `api --version` and continue

**Tell us more about your project**
- What language (and if applicable, framework) are you using? 
- Have you been able to successfully go through [adding Optic to your project](https://docs.useoptic.com/getting-started/setup/)? 
- Where did the process fail, and what error message did you receive?

**Additional details and screenshots**
Do you have any additional notes you'd like to share? If applicable, a copy-paste of the error message or a screenshot will help us get you on the right path.
