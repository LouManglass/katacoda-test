Let's run some code!

We've already installed the Optic tools in this environment. They're available via `npm` if you want to install them locally. Just run `npm install --global @useoptic/optic-cli`{{execute "HOST1"}}. You can give it a shot here to update the CLI if you'd like.

This installs the Optic local CLI, which you can run through the `api` command. Give it a shot now to validate that everything is installed with `api --version`{{execute "HOST1"}}.
