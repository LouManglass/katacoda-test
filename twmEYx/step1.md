Before we can monitor an API with Optic, we'll have to install the tooling. Optic is available via `npm` via `npm install @useoptic/cli`{{execute "HOST1"}}. We'd recommend including the --global flag in your local environment so that you can use Optic across all projects.

This installs the Optic local CLI, which you can run through the `api` command. Give it a shot now to validate that everything is installed with `api --version`{{execute "HOST1"}}.

That's it! Optic is available in your terminal. Next, let's install an API to observe.
