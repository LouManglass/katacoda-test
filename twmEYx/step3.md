Now that we know we have our Optic software installed and we have a target API, let's set up Optic.

In the terminal, run `api init`{{execute "HOST1"}}. This will initialize the Optic files in the `/app` directory of the sample server. Of note, it will create an `optic.yml` file. Let's dig into that more in the next step. For now, you'll need to give Optic a little information:

- Is this your API's root directory? (yes/no): `yes`{{execute "HOST1"}}
- What is this API named?: `Optic demo`{{execute "HOST1"}}
